Decision trees for NCDs(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4466856/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The decision tree method is a powerful statistical tool for classification, prediction, interpretation, and data manipulation that has several potential applications in medical research. Using decision tree models to describe research findings has the following advantages:

• Simplifies complex relationships between input variables and target variables by dividing original input variables into significant subgroups.

• Easy to understand and interpret.

• Non-parametric approach without distributional assumptions.

• Easy to handle missing values without needing to resort to imputation.

• Easy to handle heavy skewed data without needing to resort to data transformation.

• Robust to outliers.
